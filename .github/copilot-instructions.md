## Project Overview
This is a Next.js 15 project for ANKID - a gamified learning adventure app that helps users study with flashcards through an engaging, game-like experience.

## Key Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Material 3 Expressive Design System
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Design System**: Material 3 Expressive with custom CSS variables

## Design Principles
- **Material 3 Expressive**: Use personality-driven design with dynamic typography, expressive motion, and vibrant colors
- **Typography**: Plus Jakarta Sans for headings, Inter for body text
- **Colors**: Primary (#45bfdb), Secondary (#f5dd59), Tertiary (#ff6b9d)
- **Motion**: Emphasized easing curves, 3D transforms, gradient animations
- **Components**: Rounded rectangles for progress bars, organic shapes, micro-interactions

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Implement proper React patterns (hooks, component composition)
- Follow Next.js best practices (App Router, server/client components)
- Use Tailwind CSS classes with custom CSS variables for Material 3 design
- Create reusable components for UI elements (buttons, cards, progress bars)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions and file structure

## Component Guidelines
- Create components in `/src/components/` directory
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add hover effects and animations for interactive elements
- Use the custom design system variables for consistent styling

## Features to Implement
- Dashboard with user stats and progress
- Flashcard study sessions with spaced repetition
- Card collection management
- Marketplace for trading cards
- Quest system with achievements
- Leaderboard and social features
- Avatar customization
- Voice synthesis for card reading
